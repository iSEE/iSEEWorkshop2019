# Workshop Description

This workshop demonstrates the use of the [_iSEE_](http://bioconductor.org/packages/iSEE/) package to create and configure interactive applications for the exploration of various types of genomics data sets (e.g., bulk and single-cell RNA-seq, CyTOF, gene expression microarray).

This workshop will be presented as a lab session that combines an instructor-led live demo, followed by hands-on experimentation guided by completely worked examples and stand-alone notes that participants may continue to use after the workshop.

The instructor-led live demo comprises three parts:

1. Brief lecture on the package concept and functionality
2. Overview of the graphical user interface
3. Instructions to preconfigure [_iSEE_](http://bioconductor.org/packages/iSEE/) apps

The hands-on lab comprises three part:

1. Inspection of single-cell RNA-seq data at various steps of a typical computational workflow, including quality control and dimensionality reduction
2. Addition of custom panels to the user interface for advanced visualization.
3. Additional questions from the participants, including individual use cases and suggestions for future developments

Participants are encouraged to ask questions at any time during the workshop.

## Pre-requisites

* Basic knowledge of [_R_](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) syntax and the use of data-frames
* Familiarity with the [`SummarizedExperiment`](http://bioconductor.org/packages/SummarizedExperiment) and [`SingleCellExperiment`](http://bioconductor.org/packages/SingleCellExperiment) classes
* Familiarity with the [_shiny_](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=shiny) CRAN package
* Familiarity with the [_scRNAseq_](http://bioconductor.org/packages/scRNAseq/) package and [vignette](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/experiment/vignettes/scRNAseq/inst/doc/scRNAseq.html)

Additional background reading about the programming environment, relevant packages, and example use cases:

* Shiny from RStudio: https://shiny.rstudio.com
* SummarizedExperiment paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3252 (Figure 2)
* iSEE paper: https://f1000research.com/articles/7-741/v1

## Workshop Participation

Students will participate by following along an [_R markdown_](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) document, and asking questions throughout the workshop.
There is also scope for participants to apply  [_iSEE_](http://bioconductor.org/packages/iSEE/) to their own data sets, and fuel the discussion with more questions about specific use cases.
